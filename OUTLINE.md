## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

#### 1. **API Data Source Reliability**
- **Risk**: Free APIs may be unreliable or rate-limited
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Build abstraction layer for easy provider switching
  - Implement fallback to multiple providers
  - Cache aggressively
  - Start with 2 sports to reduce API calls

#### 2. **Time Constraint**
- **Risk**: 2 weeks is extremely tight
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ruthless scope management
  - Focus on core features only
  - Use Django's built-in features extensively
  - Minimal custom UI (Bootstrap templates)
  - Skip nice-to-haves

#### 3. **Data Quality**
- **Risk**: Sports data can be inconsistent
- **Mitigation**:
  - Data validation layer
  - Error logging
  - Manual override capability in admin
  - Graceful degradation

#### 4. **Performance Under Load**
- **Risk**: May not scale to Fortune 100 traffic
- **Mitigation**:
  - Database indexing from start
  - Basic caching (Redis)
  - Optimize queries (select_related, prefetch_related)
  - Note: Deep performance tuning post-MVP

---

## Tech Debt & Future Improvements

### Known Shortcuts (Document These)
1. **Polling instead of WebSockets** - Will cause more server load
2. **Basic caching only** - Need advanced cache invalidation strategy
3. **Limited error handling** - Needs comprehensive error tracking
4. **No user accounts** - Authentication needed for personalization
5. **Simple frontend** - May need React/Vue for better UX
6. **2 sports only** - Architecture supports more, needs implementation
7. **Basic test coverage** - Should be 85%+ for production

### Post-Launch Priorities
1. Increase test coverage to 85%+
2. Implement comprehensive caching strategy
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
4. User authentication and preferences
5. Advanced analytics and statistics
6. Performance optimization and load testing
7. Security audit and penetration testing
8. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Legal & Compliance Notes

### ⚠️ Critical Considerations
1. **Data Licensing**:

   - Some sports data requires licensing fees
   - Official league data may require agreements
   - Free APIs may have usage restrictions

2. **Trademark/Copyright**:
   - Team logos are trademarked
   - League names are trademarked
   - Use data only, not copyrighted assets
   - Fair use doctrine may apply (consult legal)

3. **Terms of Service**:
   - ESPN hidden API - unofficial, use at own risk
   - TheSportsDB - check free tier limits
   - RapidAPI - read usage restrictions

4. **Recommendation**: 
   - For MVP: Use free APIs with attribution
   - For Fortune 100: Purchase official data licenses
   - Budget $1,000-10,000+/year for licensed data

## Final Notes

### Reality Check
This is an **aggressive MVP timeline** for a fully-featured application. A Fortune 100-quality product typically requires:
- 3-6 months for proper development
- Dedicated QA team
- Security audits
- Performance testing at scale
- Legal review for data licensing
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment

### What This 2-Week MVP Achieves
- ✅ Feature-complete application (runs locally)
- ✅ Professional code quality (75-80% test coverage)
- ✅ Working REST API with documentation
- ✅ Clean web interface with real data
- ✅ Automated background data refresh
- ✅ TDD best practices demonstrated
- ✅ Docker-ready architecture
- ✅ Production-ready codebase structure
- ✅ **100% FREE - No costs incurred**
- ✅ Portfolio-worthy project

### What's Missing (Future Enhancements)
- ❌ Cloud deployment (runs locally only)
- ❌ Enterprise-scale performance tuning
- ❌ Comprehensive security audit
- ❌ Advanced features (WebSockets, AI predictions)
- ❌ Licensed official data (using free APIs)
- ❌ User authentication system
- ❌ Production monitoring/logging
- ❌ Load balancing & scaling infrastructure

### Recommendation
**Present this as**: 
"Fully-functional sports data aggregation platform with professional code quality, comprehensive testing, and modern architecture. Built using TDD methodologies with 75-80% test coverage. **Ready for deployment when needed** - currently optimized for local development with Docker. Can be deployed to production in 1-2 days when required."

### What Happens After 2 Weeks?
You'll have a **complete, working application** that:
1. Runs perfectly on your local machine
2. Can be demoed to anyone (just run `docker-compose up`)
3. Is ready to deploy whenever you want (just follow deployment docs)
4. Has professional-grade code quality
5. Can be expanded with new features easily
6. **Cost you $0 to build**

When you're ready to deploy later, you can:
- Deploy to free tier (Render/Railway) for demos
- Deploy to paid hosting ($15-25/mo) for production
- Scale up as needed
- But for now - 100% local, 100% free!

---

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Which 2-3 sports to prioritize?** (NFL + NBA recommended, +MLB if time permits)
2. **Database preference?** (PostgreSQL via Docker OR SQLite for simplicity?)
3. **Data source preference?** (ESPN Hidden API, TheSportsDB, or API-Sports?)
4. **Frontend style?** (Clean & minimal OR feature-rich dashboard?)
5. **Focus areas?** (More sports OR more features per sport?)
6. **Testing priority?** (Aim for 75% or push for 80%+ coverage?)
7. **Extra features?** (Charts/graphs, search, historical data - which to prioritize?)
