## Next Steps (When We Resume)

### **Immediate Next: Days 5-6 - REST API Development**

#### 1. **Create DRF Serializers** (apps/api/serializers.py)
- LeagueSerializer
- TeamSerializer (with league nested)
- GameSerializer (with nested teams, scores)
- PlayerSerializer (with team nested)
- ScoreSerializer

#### 2. **Create DRF ViewSets** (apps/api/viewsets.py)
- LeagueViewSet (list, retrieve, read-only)
- TeamViewSet (list, retrieve, filter by league)
- GameViewSet (list, retrieve, filter by date/league/team/status)
- PlayerViewSet (list, retrieve, filter by team)
- ScoreViewSet (accessed via game nested routes)

#### 3. **Add API URLs** (apps/api/urls.py)
- Register all viewsets with DefaultRouter
- Configure API root view
- Add drf-spectacular for OpenAPI docs at /api/schema/

#### 4. **Implement Filtering**
- django-filter for complex queries
- GameViewSet: filter by league, team, status, date range
- TeamViewSet: filter by league
- PlayerViewSet: filter by team, position
- Search by name fields

#### 5. **Write API Tests** (apps/api/tests/)
- Test list/retrieve operations
- Test filtering and pagination
- Test response formats and status codes
- Test nested serializers
- Test error handling (404s, validation)
- Target 90%+ coverage

#### 6. **API Documentation**
- Configure drf-spectacular
- Add OpenAPI schema generation
- Browsable API interface
- Add docstrings to viewsets

## How to Resume Work

### **Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/tatejones/Projects/Sports_Game_Tracker

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Pull latest changes (if working from different machine)
git pull origin main

# Run migrations (if any new ones)
python manage.py migrate

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver

# In separate terminals (optional for background tasks):
# Start Redis
docker-compose up -d redis

# Start Celery worker
celery -A config worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery beat
celery -A config beat --loglevel=info
```

### **Run Tests:**
```bash
# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=70

# Specific test file
pytest apps/data_ingestion/tests/test_tasks.py -v

# Fast tests without coverage
pytest --no-cov
```

### **Check Current Status:**
```bash
# Git status
git status

# Latest commits
git log --oneline -5

# Test coverage report
pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

## Known Issues / Notes

### ✅ **Resolved Issues:**
1. **Debug Toolbar NoReverseMatch** - Fixed URL configuration in config/urls.py
2. **Celery Import Hanging with Coverage** - Added lazy imports in tasks.py, excluded celery.py from coverage
3. **Model Field Errors** - Added external_id, scheduled_time, period, time_remaining to models
4. **NOT NULL Constraints** - Fixed default values for time_remaining field

### 📝 **Important Notes:**
1. **Database:** Using SQLite for development. Switch to PostgreSQL for production via Docker Compose.
2. **Redis Required:** Must be running for Celery tasks and caching to work.
3. **ESPN API:** No authentication needed, 100% free, no rate limits observed yet.
4. **Test Settings:** Celery runs in eager mode (synchronous) during tests - no worker needed.
5. **Coverage Config:** celery.py and config/__init__.py excluded from coverage to prevent hangs.
6. **Virtual Environment:** Located at `venv/` in project root.
